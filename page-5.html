            <p>ICT, AI and in general computer-based solutions will drive technology in helping food and beverage producers protect their employees and plants against COVID-19 contamination by detecting and tracking the virus on surfaces as well as body temperature to identify a fever.</p>

            <p>However, since there are dangers embedded within the adoption of any digital technology, the current pandemic is liable to make these dangers worse. Security issues, for example, still plague the massive amounts of data generated online every day. As ICTs are clearly central to the many ways people will respond to the COVID-19 crisis, how to best safeguard the data such technologies produce will hinge on the answers to three main questions: what is too important in our every-day life to take place online? Who will protect data that needs to be stored and shared for contact tracing? Who will be held liable if such new data is left vulnerable, stolen or exploited?</p>

            <p>Future directions in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic will also have to take into account human-technology relationship as the latter is mediated by the political and institutional context in which technology is implemented.</p>
