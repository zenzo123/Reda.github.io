            <p>Properly disinfecting public spaces can help stop the spread of coronavirus protecting workers’ health but if cleaning crews do not wear appropriate PPE, they themselves are at risk for infection. PPEs such as masks and gloves can be effective in reducing the spread of viruses and disease within the food industry, but only if used properly. A disinfecting robotic arm that uses an ultraviolet (UV) light sanitizer to clean contaminated areas is being perfected at University of Southern California in Los Angeles. Cameras mounted on the robotic arm help the operator, located away from the contaminated area, to navigate the robot. The robot scans the surroundings also using infrared (IR) radiation to determine their depth and then builds a 3D model of the area. Using a gripper, the robotic arm is able to open drawers and closets, and manipulate objects to perform a thorough sanitization of hard-to-reach surfaces.</p>

            <p>Thermal imaging cameras represent a fast, contactless, and reliable method to detect a fever, a common symptom of COVID-19. IEEE members are working on projects that aim to improve the technology used in these cameras so they can be used in public spaces and commercial buildings to provide fast individual screenings to help stop the spread of the virus. Thermographic cameras used in the healthcare field must meet specific standards. For example, the screening technology must have a measurement accuracy of ± 0.5 ºC; several manufacturers of such cameras are not following those requirements. Then, software is being developed to help cameras meet technical standards required by the healthcare industry. The cameras have infrared temperature sensors and motorized focus, which are controlled by the software’s system operator. The temperature sensors detect electromagnetic waves from the person and the motorized focus allows the camera’s operator to zoom in and out.</p>

            <p>A team of researchers at Thailand’s National Electronics and Computer Technology Center has built a temperature-screening system that can examine up to nine people at a time. More places are screening people so the ability to scan several at once could eliminate waiting lines. The system combines a visible camera and a thermal imaging camera. It is equipped with features such as light detection and ranging (Lidar) remote sensing methodology and facial recognition, which can be used with or without a facial covering, to determine where a person is standing in the camera’s field of view. The system also uses an algorithm that compensates for distance shift that happens with traditional thermal-imaging-based temperature scanners. Distance shift occurs when several individuals being checked are not at the same measuring distance, leading to a fluctuation in temperature measurements. Measurements from the Lidar and other inputs are used to compensate for variations in distance between an individual and the scanner.</p>

            <p>AI has been employed against infectious diseases having the ability to rapidly track, analyze, and diagnose various infectious processes in real time. The ability of AI technology to augment decision-making processes is due to the speed of pattern recognition and the robust amount of data that are digested and analyzed for optimal outcomes.</p>

            <p>Augmented reality (AR), an interactive experience where real objects are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information, has been widely used as an instructional tool to help the user to perform the task in real world conditions. Recent advancements in AR have helped assisting operators in industrial safety applications in a control room environment by providing extra information in the decision making process.</p>

            <p>AI, Internet of things (IoT) and the resulting massive amount of streaming data, often referred to as Big Data, are having a disruptive role in food quality assessment (using sensor fusion), food safety (using gene sequencing and block chain-based digital traceability), agriculture (including intelligent farm machines and drone-based crop imaging), and finally supply-chain modernization.</p>

            <p>Mixed reality (MR) is a hybrid reality where real and virtual objects are merged to produce an enriched interactive environment; in 2019, software taking advantage of AR and MR has been used to monitor pathogens such as Salmonella and Listeria on surfaces in factories more efficiently than paper-based monitoring methods. Software taps AI to identify areas inside manufacturing plants where bacteria could be present and grow. This information is then uploaded to a cloud-based task management system; it can also be presented in real time through a MR headset, allowing the user to track and add information whilst walking the factory floor. Following the COVID-19 outbreak, such software has been updated for tracking the virus on surfaces with the same accuracy and efficiency demonstrated for other pathogens.</p>
