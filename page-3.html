            <p>As the coronavirus pandemic is unprecedented, the present work aimed to review scientific contributions and official resources published no more than two years ago.

            <p>ICT and AI are already helping in agriculture and food engineering picking vegetables, controlling pest infestations, soil and crop health monitoring and predictive analysis are only a few examples. Improving food traceability as well as the efficiency that can be gained through robotics, automation and digitization in supply chain logistics are some of key requirements for the near future of food safety. Indeed, notwithstanding the essential role of farm, factory and food workers, it is recognized that any human interaction with the food value chain, at least in the context of a virus, presents some risk.</p>

            <p>COVID-19 is a respiratory illness and the most recent advice from the WHO is that current evidence indicates that the primary transmission route of COVID-19 virus is through person-to-person contact and through direct contact with respiratory droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes. There is no evidence to date of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses being transmitted via food or food packaging. Coronaviruses cannot multiply in food; they need an animal or human host to multiply. The virus can spread directly from person-to-person when a COVID-19 case coughs or sneezes, producing droplets that reach the nose, mouth, or eyes of another person.</p>

            <p>Alternatively, as the respiratory droplets are too heavy to be airborne, they land on objects and surfaces surrounding the infected person. It is possible that someone may become infected by touching a contaminated surface, object, or the hand of an infected person and then touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes. This can happen, for instance, when touching door knobs or shaking hands and then touching the face.</p>

            <p>Recent research evaluated the survival of the COVID-19 virus on different surfaces and reported that the virus can remain viable for up to 72 hours on plastic and stainless steel, up to four hours on copper, and up to 24 hours on cardboard. Then, it is imperative for the food industry to reinforce personal hygiene measures and provide refresher training on food hygiene principles to eliminate or reduce the risk of food surfaces and food packaging materials becoming contaminated with the virus from food workers.</p>
