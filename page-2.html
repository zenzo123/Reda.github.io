            <span class="subtitle"><u><b><h2>Introduction:</h2></b></u></span>
            <p>The COVID-19 disease is having an unprecedented worldwide impact in health and socioeconomic terms; according to data provided by Johns Hopkins University, by 2020, September 21, the number of global cases passed 31 million with more than 960,000 deaths. Furthermore, the pandemic is certainly having an unprecedented impact also on food systems. This is what ITU, the United Nationsâ€™ specialized agency for ICT, reported on its online resource ITU News.</p>

            <p>WHO declared COVID-19 disease a public health emergency of international concern on 2020, January 30. The 2020 edition of the Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC), published on 2020, April 20 as the result of a joint, consensus-based assessment of acute food insecurity situations around the world, describes the worldwide scale of acute hunger. GRFC-2020 provides an analysis of the drivers that are contributing to food crises across the globe, and examines how the COVID-19 pandemic might contribute to their perpetuation or deterioration. When comparing the 50 countries taken into account in both the 2019 and the 2020 reports, the population in crisis rose from 112 to 123 million. This reflected worsening acute food insecurity in key conflict-driven crises and the growing severity of drought and economic shocks. Around 183 million people in 47 countries were classified in stressed conditions, at risk of slipping into crisis or worse. As stated by Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations (UN) and reported on GRFC-2020, the upheaval that has been set in motion by the COVID-19 pandemic may push even more families and communities into deeper distress.</p>

            <p>Even before COVID-19 began to affect food systems and agricultural livelihoods, the 55 countries and territories that are home to 135 million people were already facing acute food insecurity. Such people are in need of urgent humanitarian food and nutrition assistance and are the most vulnerable to the consequences of this pandemic as they have very limited or no capacity to cope with either the health or socioeconomic aspects of the shock. Rising levels of food insecurity and lack of access to healthcare are likely to increase malnutrition rates. On the food supply side, movement restrictions necessary to contain the spread of the virus will disrupt the transport and processing of food and other critical goods, increasing delivery times and reducing availability of even the most basic food items.</p>

            <p>Conclusions of GRFC-2020 state that, given the unprecedented nature of COVID-19 crisis, taking rapid collective action to pre-empt its impact on food security and food systems is of paramount importance and urgency. In particular, anticipatory actions have to be undertaken to safeguard the livelihoods of the most vulnerable people and related agri-food systems to protect the critical food supply chain. Early actions for mitigation include, among others, expanding near-real time, remote food security monitoring systems to provide up-to-date information on the impacts of the outbreak on food security and livelihoods, health, access to services, markets and supply chains.</p>

            <p>In this framework ICT, applied computer science and artificial intelligence (AI) will support sustainable development worldwide and in particular can play a key role in help shaping the future of food safety. The aim of the present work is outlining how state-of-the-art and trends of such technologies could be useful for the whole agri-food sector.</p>
